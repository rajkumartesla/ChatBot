# Building a Chatbot using NLP
## Introduction:
In today's world, most businesses rely on customer service, Providing customer support can be through phone or through chat by using the chatbot. We can easily provide the basic or repeated solutions that were asked by customers without any human intervention which is time and cost-saving for businesses. Most of the customers in today's world prefer to contact through messages rather than calling and being on wait for a longer time.
Gartner forecasts that 85% of customer service communications will be handled by chatbots by 2020, they currently manage about 30 percent of transactions currently. It is now increasingly common to use artificial neural networks to build chatbots, but teaching a machine to have natural conversations is very difficult and often involves broad and complicated language models. With all the updates and improvements in TensorFlow 2.0, we can easily construct complex models.
## Statement of the Problem:
So what is a chatbot?
A chatbot is a piece of software operated by artificial intelligence on a smartphone (Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant, etc.), application, website, or other networks that attempt to measure the needs of customers and then assist them to perform a specific task such as a business transaction, hotel booking, form submission, etc. Nearly every organization today has a chatbot deployed to communicate with customers. Some of the ways organizations use chatbots are: 
- To answer questions about flights 
- Connecting consumers and their investments 
- As service for customers
On a number of predefined problems specific to the domain on which it is based, chatbots offer any real live chat assistance. This adapts the basic human language and meets up in a change in position with humans. Chatbots are specially designed to make it simple and safe to communicate between machines and humans.

## Review of Literature:
Studies on retrieval-based chatbots can be split into Cross-encoders that fit word throughout the pair, like many of the sequence pair matching jobs, and Bi-encoders that encrypt the pair independently. It tends to have greater performance, but as candidate responses can not be encoded offline, it is also much slower. For a while now, pre-trained multi-layer transformer frameworks were used as language templates to significantly impact a range of activities for natural language processing and information retrieval.  It has been shown that such language models are being used to build bi-encoders with a somewhat faster approximation rate in text-matching contexts, that execute nearly along with cross-encoders. This paper builds on this work by designing a sequence-based architecture that takes meaning into consideration during lessons.[Amir Vakili and Azadeh Shakery].

A detailed learning dialogue, cynical and humorous replies from a conversation design viewpoint, are generated by this ai chatbot research paper[Suzana Ilic, Reiichiro Nakano]. In a sophisticated curated data packet of 3000 interview-answering pairs, the authors implemented a seq2seq model which is the heart of our cynical medium chat. The study then shows that end-to-end systems are able to rapidly learn trends from limited databases, thereby moving basic linguistic constructs describing abstract principles to unexplored environments. The browser also has an LSTM-based encoder-decoder model, where users can communicate with the chatbot directly. Language content, imagination, and human features have been assessed and the capabilities, weaknesses, and potential of the method are revealed for future study.

## Objectives of the Study:
My main objective for this project is to establish a chatbot system for the UNT  data science department that makes it easier for students to get answers for their course-related questions and some basic information about the department. It will answer questions like “where to take an appointment for an academic advisor”? and “what are the general electives available for masters students ”? etc. 
                                         Based on how they are designed, there are two main types of chatbot models; Retrieval based and Generative based models. Predefined input patterns and responses are used by a retrieval-based chatbot. To pick the acceptable response, it then uses some kind of proposed methodology. In the market, it is commonly used to build goal-oriented chatbots where we can change the chatbot's style and function to drive our consumers with the best experience. The generative models aren't really built on any predefined answers. They are predicated on neural networks, seq 2 seq. That is the same definition as a translation by computer.

  I will use python and machine learning algorithms to build bot. The chatbot is trained using deep learning techniques with few datasets that contain patterns, categories, and responses. This is also called a retrieval based bot. Initially, I will Import necessary packages for data loading and then preprocess data like word tokenization and lemmatization next will create training and test data, training data is the one which we use to provide inputs and output patterns for bot once the training data is ready will build a deep neural network model and then run it for different responses and check the chatbot.
## Libraries:
‘Intents data.json’ is the file which we use for this project where it contains patterns and responses.
-classes.pkl - it is a file which contains a list with different types of classes of responses.
-words.pkl - this file is used for pattern recognition and it contains lists of different words.
-chatbot.py - this data file contains the python code for the project.
-chatbot_model.h5 -  created model from trained model.
NLTK- Natural Language Toolkit which is a major forum for developing python programs to work with human language data. Additionally, libraries for text processing such as classification, stemming, semantic reasoning, tokenization, tagging, parsing, wrappers etc. It also facilitates free interfaces for over 50 businesses and lexical tools such as WordNet.
## Building the Bot:
1. Import and load the data file
2. Preprocess data
3. Creating the Deep Learning Model.
4. Predict the response
5. Creating GUI for chatbot.
